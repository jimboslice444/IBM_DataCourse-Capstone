## Introduction/Business Problem
What new venues will have the most success based on comparisons made between venue presence in Toronto and New York City. Foursquare location data will be used to find every type of venue in New York City and Toronto. By comparing the presence of different types of venues in NYC and Toronto, investors and business owners will be able to see potential opportunities for building new venues.

## DATA 
Two URL's were generated to call the Foursquare venues for New York City and Toronto. The venues were collected by defining the longitude and latitude values for each city, specifying a search radius, and providing my client ID and secret from my FourSquare account into a URL. A json file of all the nearby venues was returned and a count of the venues in each venue category was tabulated into a pandas dataframe for each city.

## Methodology
