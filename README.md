## Introduction/Business Problem
What new venues will have the most success based on comparisons made between venue presence in Toronto and New York City. Foursquare location data will be used to find every type of venue in New York City and Toronto. By comparing the presence of different types of venues in NYC and Toronto, investors and business owners will be able to see potential opportunities for building new venues.

## DATA 
Two URL's were generated to call the Foursquare venues for New York City and Toronto. The venues were collected by defining the longitude and latitude values for each city, specifying a search radius, and providing my client ID and secret from my FourSquare account into a URL. A json file of all the nearby venues was returned and a count of the venues in each venue category was tabulated into a pandas dataframe for each city.

## Methodology
A comparison between every venue returned by FourSquare for Toronto and New York is shown in one dataframe. After analyzing the neighborhood venues in Toronto and New York City seperately, an overall venue comparison needed to be made between the cities. For an investor to know exactly where to open a new venue they would first need to know what type of venue is lacking in Toronto or New York City. The best way to find out which venues are lacking is to compare the venues of one city to another. Ideally, the accuracy of this could be increased by comparing more cities to New York City and Toronto. For example, the venue categories for Denver, Los Angeles, and Atlanta could be added to this comparison dataframe. But for simplicity sake only New York City and Toronto venue presence was compared. After accessing which venues are out of balance based on the highlighted dataframe, the investor could take a more in depth look at Toronto or New York City by examining the dataframe that displays the top venues of every neighborhood in the city. Furthermore, the investor could look at the folium map, which uses Kmeans clustering to provide a visualization for the most common venues in each neighborhood around the city. Other statistical data such as the average occurence of a venue in each neighborhood, as well as the frequency of the top venues in each neighborhood are provided as well.
